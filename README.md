  ## Description

  This project is the back end for an e-commerce site built using Express.js and Sequelize as the ORM to interact with a MySQL database. It provides a convenient and organized way to manage products, categories, and tags, allowing seamless integration into a front-end, e-commerce application.


  ## Installation

  Clone the repository from my Github and install the necessary dependencies by "npm install" in the terminal. Create a MySQL database and update the env file, then run seeds.


  ## Usage

  Enter "node server" in the terminal and the site will load at 'http://localhost:3001'. Requests can be made using the appropriate API routes.

  ## Tests

 I tested this app using Postman to ensure that my routes were connected to the site and working as expected. I created a GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE request for each route.
